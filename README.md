### Configuration

The project needs to be configured with your Auth0 configurations in order for the authentication flow to work.

To do this, first copy `auth_config.json.example` into a new file in the same folder called `auth_config.json`, and replace the values within with your own Auth0 application credentials:

```json
{
  "domain": "<YOUR AUTH0 DOMAIN>",
  "clientId": "<YOUR AUTH0 CLIENT ID>"
}

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
